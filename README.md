# TV Script Generation

## Udacity DLND

### Project Overview


In this project, we'll generate our own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. We'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
