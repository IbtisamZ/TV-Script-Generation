# TV Script Generation

## Udacity DLND

### Project Overview


In this project, we'll generate our own [Seinfeld TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) scripts using RNNs. We'll be using part of the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
